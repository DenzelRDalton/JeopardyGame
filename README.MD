This is a simple Jeopardy game I made to practice my vanilla html, css, and javascript skills. 
It is an extension of another project that I found online with several major additions including: jService api for questions and categories, multiplayer system, improved score keeping, and a many other smaller changes.

An important note about the jService api this project is built around.

According to the maintainers of the jService api which is used extensively in this application to generate questions and categories, the service exists on a small heroku instance and availability is not guaranteed.

Since this project is built around this api there may be times when the underlying service is down and the application does not work as expected.
I may look into building a backend question database/api at some point but for now jService remains the backbone of the project.
